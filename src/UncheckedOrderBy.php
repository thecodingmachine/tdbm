 * This is done to prevent SQL injections.
 *
 * If you need to order on an expression, you can wrap your ORDERBY clause in this class.
 *
 * For instance:
 *
 * $this->find(null, null, new UncheckedOrderBy('RAND()'));
 *
 * Note: you understand that arguments passed inside the `UncheckedOrderBy` constructor are NOT protected and
 * can be used for an SQL injection based attack. Therefore, you understand that you MUST NOT put input from the user
